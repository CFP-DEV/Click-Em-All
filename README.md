# Develop Hangout - Coding Challenge - June 2018

##  Building A Game

The goal of this challenge is to build a clicker style game. You are only allowed to use:

- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS (Sass, SCSS, ect)
- HTML

## Game Details

The game should have a grid of squares that can be clicked on. Each click will generate points which the player can use to buy upgrades. Upgrades should give effects like:

- increased points per click (clickable square should visually change)
- automatic Clicking/point generation
- more squares to click on

The player's progress should be savable and there should be a "High Scores" list.

The visual style/graphics will be entirely up to you. They can be simple colors or highly detailed pixel art. Just remember that no animation libraries or assets can be used, so you aren't allowed to search Google for images to use. Every part of the game must be completely original code and assets.

# Rules

1. You are only allowed to use Vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML. You can use SASS or another CSS pre-processor
2. No outside assets. This means you cannot use someone else's images/graphics
3. No extra libraries or packages
4. All code must be original and created by you
5. The game must have:
  - Grid of clickable "squares" which generates "points"
  - "Upgrades", purchasable with points, that represent game progression
  - "Level" system (such as more "squares" to click on)
  - Persistent Player Scores
    - The players score should save when they leave
    - Should support multiple player "profiles"
    - Should support list of "High Scores"
